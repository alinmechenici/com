I love building secure platforms, strong teams and cultures.

My latest startup is [CHENIST Cybersecurity](https://chen.ist/). In the past I bootstrapped 2 NGOs and 3 companies (in two countries) and worked with clients and partners like NASA, Mjardevi Science Park, etc, but also with SMEs and NGOs. 

My main skills:

- Configuration management and hardening of Unix servers for secure, reliable, declarative and reproducible systems
- Preserving privacy and anonymity of key stakeholders and employees
- Security by design for data at rest and data in movement
- Identity and Access Management, Device Management, Data Loss Prevention, Digital Risk Management
- Cyber Hygiene and Awareness
