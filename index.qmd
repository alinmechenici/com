Welcome to my website!

I am the CEO of [CHENIST](https://chen.ist/) the proactive cybersecurity company that is behing: [chenist.academy](https://chenist.academy/), [chenist.club](https://chenist.club/) and [chenist.digital](chenist.digital) projects. Follow our [events](events.html) page to see how we are trying to change the world, one step at a time.

As an entrepreneur, trainer and cybersecurity consultant, I will use this webpage to help you stay motivated and become more cyber resilient. But I am also a rider, I love art, math and phylosophy. Hopefully, my new blog and soon the podcast I will start, it will help you in some ways. I am writing A.I. free content in [English](posts.html) and [Romanian](ro.html), but I will use some A.I. to help me keep my [Swedish](sv.html) up to date. 

For my entrepreneurial journey, some technical articles on cybersecurity, open-source and probably some travel experiences I have with my cruiser and my cool and silent electric motorcycle on the hot streets, follow my RSS feed and subscribe to my substack newsletter.
